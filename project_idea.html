		<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>While going down a rather different route from my choice of a career path, my idea for a project is one of a game. The concept surrounds a young heroine battling with the never-ending onslaught of anxiety, depression and general loss of hope. Progression of a man trying to live day-by-day as everyone else but having a voice constantly in the back of his mind, creating shapes and bringing back painful memories that continue to make the heroine’s life fall further and further into disrepair. Starting strong and seemingly fine, I want to try and portray the fragility of one’s mind using this very actively involved medium.</p>

		<h2>Motivation</h2>
			<p>The motivation behind this piece comes from two rather varying sources. First would have to be from personal experiences that I have seen while growing up, my friends and family that have struggled through personal pains, to personal struggles through the years with self-confidence and anxiety. </p>
			<p>The second key motivator is that of games that I have previously played that really caught my eye and creative edge when portraying difficult topics such as mental illness. The best example of this that springs to mind is a game called Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice (Ninja Theory, 2017). Hellblade covers mental illness from a very forefront position, using constant chatter and ramblings to full effect to help portray a heroine fraught with pain and suffering. To me, this experience was something that actively took the medium being used into account to create a full experience that just cannot be replicated otherwise. </p>

		<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>To begin, the setting idea is that of a more modern era, centred around an office worker with a family. The setting should be representative of a normal household, and loving father or mother, that works day in and day out in order to put food on the table. Initially could sit in a setting where the husband and wife are arguing, creating initial tension and setting up a scene where the heroine leaves the house and goes for a walk down the street. This could set up the first point of negative voices.</p>
			<p>Throughout the experience, I would want to try and use irregular, yet invisible, voices to act as the game’s main enemy/antagonist. The idea is that the further you progress through the story, the more surreal the voices and their questions become. As a player, you will witness the progression of these events first-hand, initially starting out as family arguments with a little emphasis on the constant “voice in the head”, gradually turning into a battle against the characters own self-deprecation. </p>
			<p>As far as in-game mechanics go, there would be a couple of points that I think would help make the experience more “realistic” as such. The constant chatter would be a focal point of the game, so using full 360-degree microphones to try and match the in your head mentality would be required. It would only be one singular voice, the characters inner mind. The voice isn’t always going to be totally negative either, there will be moments where it can be somewhat motivational, at points in the story when the player is slowly getting through a hard time or has succeeded at something. It is normal for people to praise themselves after all. But this can also then be used against the player, use them to create situations that might feel as though they will lead towards a better outcome. </p>
			<p>Which leads me to my second feature in the game, false and misleading choices. Giving players a choice, or at least seemingly so, is a staple for a well-constructed single player campaign. However, in this instant I don’t want this to be entirely “fair”. Either crafting options at critical points in the story that are either choosing from the lesser of multiple evils, or having the player select from a set of options that have a mix of good and bad responses. However, if the “good” responses are selected, the voice comes back and changes the decision, the voice line to that of a more detrimental affair. Because when you are down, it really is all in your head, and I want to portray this to as an extreme level as possible while keeping the scene of a normal, almost happy looking character or heroine alive. At least, initially so anyway.</p>
			<p>Finally, to match with the choice option I just went through, I would like the game to have at least a few different possible outcomes. This not only assists with replay ability, but also opens the game for further, more permanent and pivotal story points to occur that feel like they have meaning.</p>

		<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
			<p>As an engine I have seen a little of, I feel the use of Unreal Engine (Epic Games, 2019) would be a good base to run the game from, as it is a very well known engine that operates through C++ as its base coding language. You would also need suitable computing power in order to render the game, microphones and tracking hardware to create human-like characters in-game. </p>

		<h2>Skills Required</h2>
			<p>Knowledge of Unreal Engine, C++, graphic design, sound engineering and storyboarding would be the main basic requirements for the job. There wouldn’t be too much in the way of specialist equipment that would be required however, as video game creation is a rather active field with readily available gear. Motion capture equipment would likely be the most specialised equipment that would be required. Finding assistance in the form of external developers, sound engineers, actors however, would most likely be necessary for the project to truly come together cohesively, or at least sooner rather than later. </p>

		<h2>Outcome</h2>
			<p>For me, the general outcome of a project of this scope would be to try and create further understanding of the tough topic that is mental illness, no matter how insignificant it may appear on the surface. The outcome at the end of a playthrough would be one of the players creations, depicting an ending based on choices created throughout gameplay. To reiterate, the end impact that this game would be intended to have, is one of further understanding into the mind of someone that is fighting against them. Because mental illness is nothing to squander at. </p>
