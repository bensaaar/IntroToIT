		<p>I decided to have a look at a job that was slightly different to standard career paths this course would usually lead to and was rather intrigued. Using experience brought about from an interest in the IT field, a job as a data scientist requires the use of practical code knowledge, statistical awareness and using these to assist a business with trend and scope identification. </p>
		<p>This appears to be how it sits within the scope of this job as well, along with requiring one to be able to prototype tests based on returned results, providing optimal solutions and usage of oneâ€™s abilities to assist the business forecast future business transitions and changes for the inevitable benefit of the company.</p>
		<p>Currently, I have experience working as an IT Service Technician, working to assist the customer with general troubleshooting of machine and software-based problems, along with management and administration over an Active Directory based system that uses systems such as SCCM, group policy functions as well as working is and around Cisco and Meraki networking consoles. </p>
		<p>However, all this experience I have generated has been come from general learning through Full-Time work and no formal qualifications in the field.</p>
		<p>If I were to work towards a role in the Data Science field, I would need to develop and get a better understanding behind coding as well as develop an understanding of data from a more statistical point of view. As someone who has always had a keen interest in puzzles, complex challenges and the like, this type of role has certainly caught my intrigue.</p>
		<p>My steps towards being able to obtain a job are what I currently have in motion. The University degree is not only a pre-requisite for many jobs in the IT field but is what I plan on building from. Whether it is using the coding skills that I learn down the line, to personal learning using Online resources. I also plan to continue excelling at my current Service Technician role, continuing to progress my personal knowledge, as well as look for opportunities to work alongside and eventually for, more specialised teams. I have one step in, I just need to make the most of what I have going for me.
