		<h3>Full Name: Benjamin James Saar</h3>
		<h3>Student Number: S3856805</h3>

		<h2>Background Information:</h2>
			<p>I am an Australian native by birth, with an Australian born mother and an Israeli father and I have lived in Australia my entire life. Unfortunately, I can only speak English, as I found myself out to being hopeless at other languages when given the opportunity.</p>
			<p>Since graduating High School in 2014, I have started a few different University degrees, including Journalism and Psychology, before falling onto a degree that I believe to be more suited to who I am as a person, Information Technology.</p>
			<p>One fact about myself is that I am an avid football (soccer) fan and in the past, player. I played for close to 19 years straight of outdoor soccer, playing at a relatively competitive level, before continuing with indoor soccer as time began to become harder to come by.</p>
		<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			<p>I currently work as a general service technician for an IT company in Melbourne, where I have continued to grow a love and certain level of respect for IT. It was a big part of why I have decided to come back to University, so that I may further my personal experiences as well as find further opportunities into the future.</p>
			<p>That all being said, I have spent most of my life being in and around computers. Building them from the ground up with parts that I could find strewn around the place, to also being an avid gamer to this day. </p>
			<p>I chose RMIT for several reasons. First and foremost, I decided that for my current lifestyle, working Online was by far the best-case scenario that would allow me to continue working full-time while still making the time for study. RMIT had the readily available option of operating through Open Universities, so that made my decision far easier. I also have several good friends that have gone to, or are currently at, RMIT that only have high praise for the University. </p>
			<p>During my time at RMIT studying Information Technology, I hope to learn more about the operational infrastructure behind IT in the business space, how systems and networks operate to a more structured level, as well as personally learn a bit in regards to coding and development in general. There are so many avenues to Information Technology, and I am intrigued to see how they all operate cohesively with one another.
