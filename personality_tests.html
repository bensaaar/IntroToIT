		<h2>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
			<p>Results: </p>
			<p>The online version I used only provided its basic page but listed the top 3 indicators that best suited me.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>INFP – Introverted Intuitive Feeling Perceiving</li>
					<li>ISFP – Introverted Sensing Feeling Perceiving</li>
					<li>INFJ – Introverted Intuitive Feeling Judging</li>
				</ol>
		<h2>Learning Style Test</h2>
			<p>Results:</p>
			<p>I chose to undertake the Education Planner Learning Style test, where I came out as mostly a Visual / Tactile learner, over an Auditory learner.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Auditory: 20%</li>
					<li>Visual: 40%</li>
					<li>Tactile: 40%</li>
				</ul>
		<h2>The Big Five Personality Test</h2>
			<p>For my choice personality test, I chose to undertake the Big Five personality test. This test is measured under five categories, Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism (OCEAN).</p>
			<p>Results:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Openness: 62.5%</li>
					<li>Conscientiousness: 48%</li>
					<li>Extraversion: 48%</li>
					<li>Agreeableness: 79%</li>
					<li>Neuroticism: 65%</li>
				</ul>

		<h3>What do these results mean to me?</h3>
			<p>As it appears to me, based on the outcomes of the tests that I took, the test that stands out as the most accurate in my eyes would be the Learning Style Test. I have always been somebody that has benefitted from physically being able to use my own hands and see what needs to be done in order to learn most effectively. In comparison, the lower score under the Auditory field certainly feels accurate, as I have found my retention to be far worse when the information is given to me only in an auditory format. So standard lectures, classroom teachings and the like depending on the teaching styles, can be difficult for me.</p>
			<p>However, the two personality tests I believe don’t show the full picture for myself. Both the Myer’s-Briggs and Big Five tests seem to put me in a more introverted space, which I don’t particularly deny, however I am also someone who spends a lot of time out with friends and people I don’t know, and can have a good time without feeling totally overwhelmed. They also seem to point towards me being someone that is very emotional, rather than one of calculation. While true in some aspects of life I’m sure, I just can’t agree with this in its entirety.</p>
				<br></br>
		<h3>How will they influence my behaviour in a team?</h3>
			<p>I don’t believe these results would affect how I would go about working in a team, as a team is a collective of people that work off one another’s strengths and weaknesses. However, this doesn’t always work out and based on the results of the personality indicator tests I took, the Myers-Briggs test shows me out as being someone that be the empathetic team member that will put a foot forward to aid my fellow group members. Paired with the Big Five test rating me highly on Agreeableness, I feel my contributing features to the team seem to match well with keeping a team cohesively together. </p>
				<br></br>
		<h3>How should this be considered when forming a team?</h3>
			<p>When considering the personalities of individual members of any group, I believe having many different types of people is the most effective way of creating a diverse, yet well-structured team. If you have too many people that are introverts, there would be severe lack of communication where a team of extroverts could become poorly organised and messy. People that are more emotionally focused can offer a different perspective of an idea that a strictly calculated individual couldn’t fathom. Not all groups of people are going to be perfect, however I do believe that given everybody will be characteristically different in some way, there shouldn’t be any disadvantages for taking these into account.
